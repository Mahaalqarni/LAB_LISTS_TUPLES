# ## Movie Ratings Analysis

# Scenario:
# You have just been hired as a data analyst at a movie streaming platform. 
# Your manager has given you a list of movies, each with a tuple containing the movie title, 
# release year, and user ratings. The platform allows users to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 10. 
# Your manager wants you to create a Python program that:
# 
# 1. Accepts a list of movies, with each movie represented as a tuple containing the movie title, release year, and a list of user ratings.
# 2. Calculates the average rating for each movie.
# 3. Filters out movies with an average rating lower than 6.0.
# 5. Displays the  movies, along with their title, release year, and average rating.
